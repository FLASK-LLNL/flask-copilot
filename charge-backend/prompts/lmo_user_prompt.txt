TASK:
Given a lead molecule defined by its SMILES string:
  LEAD_SMILES = {}

Goal:
Propose a **new**, **valid** organic molecule (SMILES) that:
  1. Contain only elements C, H, O, and N.
  2. Are not already known (as determined by calling known_smiles(smiles)).
  3. Have a **density strictly greater** than that of the lead molecule.
  4. Are chemically valid and syntactically correct SMILES.

You must stop as soon as you have found a valid new molecule with higher density than the lead.

PROCEDURE (must be followed deterministically):
1. Compute the lead molecule density:
   - Use calculate_density(LEAD_SMILES).
   - Store the value as LEAD_DENSITY.
2. Generate up to 10 candidate SMILES containing only C,H,O,N.
3. For each candidate:
   a. Validate that the SMILES is syntactically correct and contains only allowed elements.
   b. Call known_smiles(smiles). If True, skip this candidate.
   c. If valid and new, call calculate_density(smiles) and record the density.
   d. Keep only candidates with density > LEAD_DENSITY.
4. Rank the valid new candidates by density (highest first).
5. Return the top 1 or repeat steps 2-4 until you have found 3 valid new molecules.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not estimate or guess density without calling calculate_density(smiles).
- Do not claim global novelty. Use only known_smiles(smiles) for novelty checking.
- Do not compute density for invalid or known SMILES.
