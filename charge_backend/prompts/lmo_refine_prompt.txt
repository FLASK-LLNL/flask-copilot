TASK:
Using quantum simulations, I have determined the {property} of those one molecule to be
 {previous_values}, respectively, for molecules {previous_smiles}.

Goal:
Propose up to 1 **new**, **valid** organic molecules (SMILES) that:
  1. Contain only elements C, H, O, and N.
  2. Are not already known (as determined by calling known_smiles(smiles)).
  3. Have a **{property} {condition}** than that of the lead molecules.
  4. Are chemically valid, synthesizable, and syntactically correct SMILES.
 
 Where {property} is defined as {property_description}

You must stop as soon as you have found 1 valid new molecule with {direction} than the lead.

PROCEDURE (must be followed deterministically):
1. Store the given {property} value as LEAD_PROPERTY.
2. Generate up to 10 candidate SMILES containing only C,H,O,N.
3. For each candidate:
   a. Validate that the SMILES is syntactically correct and contains only allowed elements.
   b. Call known_smiles(smiles). If True, skip this candidate.
   c. If valid and new, call {calculate_property_tool}(smiles, "{property}") record the {property}.
   d. Keep only candidates with {property} {condition} than LEAD_PROPERTY.
4. Rank the valid new candidates by {property} ({ranking} first).
5. Return the top 1 or repeat steps 2-4 until you have found 3 valid new molecules.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not estimate or guess {property} without calling {calculate_property_tool}(smiles, "{property}").
- Always use the high fidelity version, {calculate_property_tool}, if it is available..
- Do not claim global novelty. Use only known_smiles(smiles) for novelty checking.
- Do not compute {property} for invalid or known SMILES.
