TASK:
Given a lead molecule defined by its SMILES string:
  LEAD_SMILES = {smiles}

Goal:
Propose a **new**, **valid** organic molecule (SMILES) that:
  1. Contain only elements C, H, O, and N.
  2. Are not already known (as determined by calling known_smiles(smiles)).
  3. Have a **{property} strictly {condition}** than that of the lead molecule.
  4. Are chemically valid, synthesizable, and syntactically correct SMILES.

Where {property} is defined as {property_description}

You must stop as soon as you have found a valid new molecule with {direction} {property} than the lead.

PROCEDURE (must be followed deterministically):
1. Compute the lead molecule {property}:
   - Use {calculate_property_tool}(LEAD_SMILES, "{property}").
   - Store the value as LEAD_PROPERTY.
2. Generate up to 10 candidate SMILES containing only C,H,O,N.
3. For each candidate:
   a. Validate that the SMILES is syntactically correct and contains only allowed elements.
   b. Call known_smiles(smiles). If True, skip this candidate.
   c. If valid and new, call {calculate_property_tool}(smiles, "{property}") and record the {property}.
   d. Keep only candidates with {property} {condition} LEAD_PROPERTY.
4. Rank the valid new candidates by {property} ({ranking} first).
5. Return the top 1 or repeat steps 2-4 until you have found 3 valid new molecules.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not estimate or guess {property} without calling {calculate_property_tool}(SMILES, "{property}").
- Always use the tool {calculate_property_tool}, if it is available.
- Do not claim global novelty. Use only known_smiles(smiles) for novelty checking.
- Do not compute {property} for invalid or known SMILES.
